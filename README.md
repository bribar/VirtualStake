Theme Settings
---
The Virtual Stake theme has some customizations through the Wordpress Admin Menu \> Theme Settings.

1. Layout Tab

	###### Site Logo
	
	If you click the text within the white box above {No Logo Set} you can change your site title and description. For the https://riversidestake.church the title is the name of the stake and the description is the stake theme. Your free to set it up as your wish. 
	
	###### Site Backgound
	
	If you have a nice background image you want to use this will appear as the background of the home blog page. Dimension should be at least 1600 pixels wide for best results
	
	###### Site Theme & Color
	
	Currently "Minimal" is the only theme option but you can change your site color.
	
	###### UIKit
	
	Web developer or designer recommended.
	
2. Menus Tab - Web developer or designer may be required

	If you need to add more menus than the current site navigation on the home page then you can setup menu locations here.
	
	Menus are setup under Wordpress Admin Menu \> Appearance \> Menus. When creating a menu you can assign it to a menu location. Any menu locations you have created in Theme Setting would appear here.
	
	When adding a new theme menu location through theme settings, the "Theme Hook" is required. This places the assigned menus to this area of the theme.
	
3. Sidebars Tab - Web developer or designer may be required

	This works similarly to the Menus Tab.
	
	The main difference is that the sidebars are added to Wordpress Admin Menu \> Appearance \> Widgets. Currently the theme has one sidebar called "After Navigation". Any available widgets added to this sidebar would show up under the sites navigation.
	
	If you need to add more widgets to different areas of the site, you would do this through the Sidebars Tab by selecting the appropriate "Theme Hook"
